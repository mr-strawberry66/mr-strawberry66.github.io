Computer vision is a subject that has always interested me. From a workplace perspective, I thought about being able to read contracts and extract data from them to use in some of our automated processes.

<br>

However, I couldn't get the sign off to spend time doing that, so I thought the next best thing would be to build something for myself.

<br>

So, I invested in an [Arduino starter kit](https://www.jaycar.com.au/arduino-compatible-duinotech-learning-kit/p/XC3900) and decided to make a webcam that will follow my face as I move around. 

<br>

To do this, I needed to learn some of the [Open CV](https://docs.opencv.org/master/index.html) Python library, as well as some basic C++ in order to interface with the Arduino itself.

As always, you can find the source code for the project [here](https://github.com/mr-strawberry66/face_recognition).
