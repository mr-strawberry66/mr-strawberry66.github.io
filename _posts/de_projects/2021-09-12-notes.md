For the longest time, I've been using sticky notes to document anything important. But let's be honest, it's great for noting down a quick reminder, but maybe not so much for writing down the requirements for the latest dashboard you need to develop.

<br>

I'm a big advocate of Vim, and love the simplicity of a CLI, so I thought to myself: why not write a CLI-based notes app.

<br>

So that's exactly what I did.

Some screenshots of the app in use.
